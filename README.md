# CourseraFinalProject

The aim of this project is to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing in order to determine the cost of a rocket launch by SpaceX. Falcon 9 rocket launch cost is 62 million dollars, and other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. This information can be used by other companies to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. The cost savings for SpaceX is largely due to the reuse of the first stage, making the prediction of a successful landing crucial for determining the cost of a launch. So, this information will be interesting for another company if it wants to compete against SpaceX.

To achieve the objective of the project i followed this steps:
- Data Collection via API.
- Data Collection with Web Scraping.
- Data Wrangling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with Data Visualization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL.
- Visual analytics with maps using Folium and Dashboard creation with Plotly Dash.
- Predictive analysis using Machine Learning techniques.
